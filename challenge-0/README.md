## ✅ Tasks

### Task 1: Fork the repository

Before you start, please [fork this repository](https://github.com/microsoft/agentic-factory-hack/fork) to your GitHub account by clicking the *Fork* button in the upper right corner of the repository's main screen (or follow the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)). This will allow you to make changes to the repository and save your progress.

---

### Task 2: Launch the development environment

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to code from anywhere. It provides a fully configured environment that can be launched directly from any GitHub repository, saving you from lengthy setup times. You can access Codespaces from your browser, Visual Studio Code, or the GitHub CLI, making it easy to work from virtually any device.

To open GitHub Codespaces, click on the button below:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/)

Please select your forked repository from the dropdown and, if necessary, adjust other settings of GitHub Codespace.

> [!NOTE]
> If GitHub Codespaces is not enabled in your organization, see [enabling or disabling Codespaces for your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/enabling-or-disabling-github-codespaces-for-your-organization). If you can’t change your organization’s settings, you can also [create a free personal GitHub account](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home). The GitHub Free plan includes 120 core hours per month, equivalent to 60 hours on a 2-core machine, along with 15 GB of storage.

---

### Task 3: Log in to Azure

Before anything else, let’s log in to the Azure CLI. Paste the command below and follow the prompts.

```bash
az login --use-device-code
```

---

### Task 4: Deploy Resources

In this step, you create the resources that will be used throughout the day.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Depending on the setup for the hackathon, the Azure resources might already have been provisioned for you and you can then skip this step.
> Check with your hackathon coach what is applicable for you.

<details>
<summary>Deploy Azure resources</summary>

```bash
# Ensure you are located in the challenge-0 directory
cd challenge-0

# Make resource group name easy to identify. Use your initials or other identifier (e.g., "jd" for John Doe)
export RG_SUFFIX="<initials>"

# Set variables with your initials as suffix
export RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-tire-factory-hack-${RG_SUFFIX}"
export LOCATION="swedencentral"

# Create resource group
az group create --name $RESOURCE_GROUP --location $LOCATION

# Deploy infrastructure
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
  --template-file infra/azuredeploy.json \
  --parameters location=$LOCATION
```

⏱️ Deployment takes approximately 5-10 minutes

 
> [!TIP]
> While you are waiting for the deployment to complete, take some time to familiarize yourself with the [hackathon scenario](../README.md#scenario) and [architecture](../README.md#architecture).

</details>

### Task 5: Verify the creation of your resources

Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and find your resource group, which should now contain resources like this:

![Azure Portal Resources](./images/challenge-0-azure-portal-resources.png)

---

### Task 6: Retrieve keys for environment variables

After deploying resources, configure environment variables in the `.env` file. Ensure you're logged into **Azure CLI**, then run the `get-keys.sh` script to automatically populate the required values.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Wait until all Azure resources are successfully deployed before starting this task.
> Otherwise, the environment variables may not be extracted correctly.

```bash
# Extract connection keys
./get-keys.sh --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP

# Verify .env file
cat ../.env

# Make environment variables available in the shell
export $(cat ../.env | xargs)

```

> [!TIP]
> Keep your `.env` file handy throughout the hackathon.
> You need to re-export the environment variables each time you open a new shell or when you resume a stopped codespace.

> [!CAUTION]
> For convenience, we use key-based authentication and public network access to resources in this hackathon. In real-world implementations, you should consider stronger authentication mechanisms and additional network security.
> Never commit the `.env` file to the repository. This repo already includes `.env` in [.gitignore](../.gitignore), but if you rename the file you may need to add the new name to `.gitignore` as well.

---

### Task 7: Assign additional permissions

To perform certain tasks in the hackathon, you need the following permissions:

- `Azure AI Developer` on the **Foundry project** resource (agent/project operations)
- `Azure AI User` on the **AI Services** resource (agent create/run operations)
- `Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor` on the **Azure OpenAI** resource (calling chat completions)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Depending on the setup for the hackathon, the Azure roles might already have been assigned to you in advance, and you can then skip this step.
> Check with your hackathon coach what is applicable for you.

<details>
<summary>Assign permissions</summary>


> [!NOTE]
> Role assignments can take **5–10 minutes** to fully propagate. If you still see `PermissionDenied` errors after assigning roles, wait a few minutes, then run `az login --use-device-code` again and re-export your environment variables.


```bash
# Get your Entra ID (AAD) user object ID
ME_OBJECT_ID="$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)"

# Assign "Azure AI Developer" at the AI Foundry Project resource scope
az role assignment create \
  --assignee-object-id "$ME_OBJECT_ID" \
  --assignee-principal-type User \
  --role "Azure AI Developer" \
  --scope "$AZURE_AI_PROJECT_RESOURCE_ID"

# Assign "Azure AI User" at the AI Services resource scope
# This is required for agent operations (create/run agents)
# Derive the AI Services ID from the project resource ID
AI_SERVICES_ID="${AZURE_AI_PROJECT_RESOURCE_ID%/projects/*}"

az role assignment create \
  --assignee-object-id "$ME_OBJECT_ID" \
  --assignee-principal-type User \
  --role "Azure AI User" \
  --scope "$AI_SERVICES_ID"

# Assign "Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor" at the Azure OpenAI resource scope
# This is required for data-plane calls like: /openai/deployments/{deployment}/chat/completions
OPENAI_RESOURCE_ID="$(az cognitiveservices account show --name "$AZURE_OPENAI_SERVICE_NAME" --resource-group "$RESOURCE_GROUP" --query id -o tsv)"

az role assignment create \
  --assignee-object-id "$ME_OBJECT_ID" \
  --assignee-principal-type User \
  --role "Cognitive Services OpenAI Contributor" \
  --scope "$OPENAI_RESOURCE_ID"

# Refresh your credentials with the new permissions
az login --use-device-code
```

</details>

### Task 8: Seed Factory Sample Data

As mentioned in [Context and Background](#-context-and-background), there are several data sources used throughout the hackathon. Run the script below to upload data to **Cosmos DB** and the **Storage Account**, and to create the required APIs in **API Management**.

```bash
# Run data seeding script
./seed-data.sh
```
