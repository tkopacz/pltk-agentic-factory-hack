# Challenge 2: Building the Repair Planner Agent with GitHub Copilot

Welcome to Challenge 2!

In this challenge, you will create an intelligent **Repair Planner Agent** using .NET that generates comprehensive repair plans and work orders when faults are detected in tire manufacturing equipment. You'll leverage the `agentplanning` **GitHub Copilot** agent to guide your development and generate production-ready code.

**Expected Duration:** 45 minutes  
**Prerequisites**: [Challenge 0](../challenge-0/README.md) successfully completed

## 🎯 Objective

The goals for this challenge are:

- Pair program with **GitHub Copilot**
- Create a .NET agent using the **Foundry Agents SDK**

## 🧭 Context and Background

![Challenge 2 Scenario](./images/challenge-2-scenario.png)

The **Repair Planner Agent** is the third component in our multi-agent system. After a fault has been diagnosed, this agent:

- Determines what repair tasks need to be performed
- Finds technicians with the required skills
- Checks parts inventory
- Creates a structured Work Order

You will implement the **Repair Planner Agent** as a .NET application that reads information about `Technicians` and `PartsInventory` from **Cosmos DB**. The final Work Order is also saved in **Cosmos DB**. The following diagram illustrates the target solution.

<img src="./images/challenge-2-target-solution.png" alt="Challenge 2 Target Solution" width="60%">

❶ The **Repair Planner** is a .NET console application with `Program.cs` as its entry point.

❷ The `RepairPlannerAgent.cs` class registers the agent and orchestrates calls to other services.

❸ The `CosmosDbService.cs` class encapsulates **Cosmos DB** data access.

❹ In this exercise, the mappings between faults and required skills/parts are done as a static mapping in `FaultMappingService.cs`. In a real-world application, this would be fetched from another system.

> [!TIP]
> This is just one way to structure the solution—there are many valid approaches! If you have experience with .NET, feel free to experiment with a different architecture (e.g., dependency injection, separate class libraries, or different layering patterns).

The following mappings are used in this exercise. The `agentplanning` agent already knows these mappings, so you don't need to copy them manually.

### Using the Custom GitHub Copilot Agent (agentplanning)

**GitHub Copilot** custom agents in **VS Code** are reusable, task-specific chat personas. A custom agent bundles (1) a set of instructions (how **Copilot** should behave) and (2) an allowed set of tools (what **Copilot** can do). This makes it easy to switch into a consistent "mode" (for example, planning vs. implementation) without re-explaining context each time. In a workspace, custom agents are typically defined as `.agent.md` files under `.github/agents`.

This repository includes a specialized **GitHub Copilot** agent called `agentplanning` that knows:

- **Foundry Agents SDK** patterns (`Azure.AI.Projects` + `Microsoft.Agents.AI`)
- .NET and C# best practices
- **Cosmos DB** integration
- The fault→skills/parts mappings for this workshop

#### Agent-driven development workflow

Follow this workflow when using the agent planner:

1. **Ask the agent to plan** the component architecture
2. **Request code generation** with specific requirements
3. **Review and refine** the generated code
4. **Ask for improvements** or additional features
5. **Request tests** to validate functionality


## ✅ Tasks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The outcome depends on which model GitHub Copilot uses. Larger models (`GPT-5.2`, `Claude Sonnet 4.5`) may handle more complex prompts. Smaller models work better with focused, single-file requests.

---

### Task 1: Project setup

Create a new empty .NET application that will host your agent.

```bash
# Navigate to challenge-2 directory
cd challenge-2

# Create a new console application
dotnet new console -n RepairPlanner

# Navigate into project
cd RepairPlanner
```

---  

### Task 2: Create RepairPlanner agent with `agentplanning`

Open **GitHub Copilot Chat** (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I) and select the `agentplanning` agent in the *Agents* dropdown.

<img src="./images/challenge-2-agentplanning-selection.png" alt="agentplanner selection" width="40%">

#### Task 2.1: Architecture planning

Start with the following prompt to understand the proposed setup for the **Repair Planner Agent**.

💬 Ask the agent:

```
I need to build a Repair Planner Agent in .NET for Challenge 2
using the Foundry Agents SDK. Can you explain the architecture?
```

#### Task 2.2: Create data models

Now let the agent create the data models.

💬 Ask the agent:

```
Create all data models for the Repair Planner Agent:
- DiagnosedFault (input from previous agent)
- Technician (with skills and availability) 
- Part (inventory items)
- WorkOrder (output with tasks)
- RepairTask (individual repair steps)
- WorkOrderPartUsage (parts needed)

Use dual JSON attributes for **Cosmos DB** compatibility.
```

<details>
<summary>📋 The agent will generate code similar to this structure</summary>

```csharp
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;
using Newtonsoft.Json;

public sealed class WorkOrder
{
    [JsonPropertyName("id")]
    [JsonProperty("id")]
    public string Id { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    
    // ... more properties
}
```

</details>

#### Task 2.3: Create `FaultMappingService`

Create a service for mapping between fault/skills and fault/parts. In this exercise, it will be a static mapping of values, but in a real-world scenario this would be fetched from a dedicated system.

💬 Ask the agent:

```
Create a FaultMappingService that maps fault types to required skills and parts using hardcoded dictionaries.
```

#### Task 2.4: Create `CosmosDbService`

Let's create the data access service.

💬 Ask the agent:

```
Create a CosmosDbService that:
- Queries available technicians by skills
- Fetches parts by part numbers  
- Creates work orders
Include error handling and logging.
```

<details>
<summary>📋 The agent will generate code similar to this:</summary>

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;
using RepairPlannerAgent.Models;

namespace RepairPlannerAgent.Services
{
    public class CosmosDbService
    {
        private readonly CosmosClient _client;
        private readonly Container _techniciansContainer;
        private readonly Container _partsContainer;
        private readonly Container _machinesContainer;
        private readonly Container _workOrdersContainer;

        public CosmosDbService(string endpoint, string key, string databaseName)
        {
            _client = new CosmosClient(endpoint, key);
            var database = _client.GetDatabase(databaseName);
            
            _techniciansContainer = database.GetContainer("Technicians");
            _partsContainer = database.GetContainer("PartsInventory");
            _machinesContainer = database.GetContainer("Machines");
            _workOrdersContainer = database.GetContainer("WorkOrders");
        }

        public async Task<List<Technician>> GetAvailableTechniciansWithSkillsAsync(List<string> requiredSkills)
        {
            // query logic 
        }

        public async Task<List<Part>> GetPartsInventoryAsync(List<string> partNumbers)
        {

            // query logic 
        }

        public async Task<string> CreateWorkOrderAsync(WorkOrder workOrder)
        {

            // query logic 
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

#### Task 2.5: Create the main agent

💬 Ask the agent:
```
Create the RepairPlannerAgent class that orchestrates the entire workflow
It should register the agent, determine required skills, query technicians and parts, 
and save the work order
```

<details>
<summary>📋 The agent will generate code similar to this:</summary>

```csharp
using Azure.AI.Projects;
using Azure.AI.Projects.OpenAI;
using Microsoft.Agents.AI;

public sealed class RepairPlannerAgent(
    AIProjectClient projectClient,
    CosmosDbService cosmosDb,
    IFaultMappingService faultMapping,
    string modelDeploymentName,
    ILogger<RepairPlannerAgent> logger)
{
    private const string AgentName = "RepairPlannerAgent";
    
    public async Task EnsureAgentVersionAsync(CancellationToken ct = default)
    {
        var definition = new PromptAgentDefinition(model: modelDeploymentName)
        {
            Instructions = "..."
        };
        await projectClient.Agents.CreateAgentVersionAsync(
            AgentName, 
            new AgentVersionCreationOptions(definition), 
            ct);
    }
    
    public async Task<WorkOrder> PlanAndCreateWorkOrderAsync(DiagnosedFault fault, CancellationToken ct = default)
    {
        // 1. Get skills/parts from mapping
        // 2. Query Cosmos DB
        // 3. Build prompt and invoke agent
        // 4. Parse and save work order
    }
}
```

</details>

#### Task 2.6: Create the main program

Finally, let the `agentplanning` agent update `Program.cs` to initialize all services and run a sample fault.

💬 Ask the agent:

```
Update Program.cs to initialize all services, create a sample fault,
and demonstrate the repair planning workflow.

```

Your completed project could look similar to this:

```
RepairPlanner/
├── RepairPlanner.csproj
├── Program.cs
├── RepairPlannerAgent.cs
├── Models/
│   ├── DiagnosedFault.cs
│   ├── Technician.cs

│   └── WorkOrderPartUsage.cs
└── Services/
    ├── CosmosDbService.cs
    ├── CosmosDbOptions.cs
    └── FaultMappingService.cs
```

### Task 3: Test your agent

Try out your agent.

```bash
# Load environment variables
export $(cat ../.env | xargs)

dotnet run
```

<details>
<summary>The output should look similar to this:</summary>

```bash

```
</details>
<br/>
🎉 Congratulations! You've built a **Repair Planner Agent** in .NET using **GitHub Copilot**.

## 🚀 Go Further

> [!NOTE]
> Finished early? These tasks are **optional** extras for exploration. Feel free to move on to the next challenge — you can always come back later!

Once the basic agent works, try adding:

```
Add priority calculation based on fault severity
```

```
Add better error handling for when no technicians are available
```

```
Add structured output using `AIJsonUtilities.CreateJsonSchema` 
and `ChatResponseFormat.ForJsonSchema` for type-safe responses
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting and FAQ

<details>
<summary>Problem: Preview API warnings</summary>

Add this to your `RepairPlanner.csproj`:

```xml
<NoWarn>$(NoWarn);CA2252</NoWarn>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem: JSON parsing errors with numbers</summary>

LLMs sometimes return `"60"` instead of `60`. Use:

```csharp
NumberHandling = JsonNumberHandling.AllowReadingFromString
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Problem: **Cosmos DB** errors</summary>

Ensure you're using both `[JsonPropertyName]` and `[JsonProperty]` attributes on models.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Question: Is there a finished example solution available?</summary>

Yes, there is a complete example solution in the `example-solution/` folder. However, it is **hidden from the VS Code file explorer** by default using filters in [.vscode/settings.json](../.vscode/settings.json).

**Why is it hidden?**  
The example solution is excluded to prevent **GitHub Copilot** from directly copying it as your solution — which would defeat the purpose of the exercise! The goal is to learn by building the agent yourself with Copilot's guidance, not to have Copilot retrieve a pre-made answer.

**How to view the solution:**  
If you want to compare your work or need a reference, you can remove or comment out the filter entries in [.vscode/settings.json](../.vscode/settings.json):

```json
{
    "files.exclude": {
        "example-solution": true,           // ← remove or set to false
        "**/example-solution/**": true
    },
    "search.exclude": {
        "example-solution": true,           // ← remove or set to false
        "**/example-solution/**": true
    }
}
```

After saving the file, the `example-solution` folder will appear in the Explorer and be included in search results.

## 🧠 Conclusion and reflection


Let’s reflect on a few things

### C# vs Python

We used .NET (C#) in this challenge and Python in the previous one — both are **first-class** for building agents with modern AI/agent SDKs (including the **Foundry Agents SDK** patterns used in this workshop). Agent solutions quickly become application development (integration, data access, security, ops), so teams typically choose the language that best fits their existing stack and skills — Python often excels for rapid iteration, while .NET is common in larger enterprises for long-lived, well-governed services.

### GitHub Copilot instructions

This repo uses **VS Code** Copilot customization so the agent behaves consistently during the workshop.

> [!TIP]
> Using guided agents (clear instructions + constrained tools + repeatable steps) helps avoid “vibe coding”, where solutions can drift, skip requirements, or become hard to review. A lightweight, guided approach keeps changes aligned with the goal and makes agent output easier to validate.


<img src="./images/challenge-2-copilot-instructions.png" alt="GitHub Copilot instructions" width="50%">


The diagram above illustrates how **GitHub Copilot** combines multiple inputs to generate contextual responses:

❶ **Your prompt** — The primary instruction you provide to the agent (e.g., "Create the RepairPlannerAgent class..."). This is your direct request that drives the conversation.

❷ **Custom instructions** — Two types of instruction files shape Copilot's behavior:
   - [copilot-instructions.md](../.github/copilot-instructions.md) — General workspace-wide instructions applied to all chat requests (SDK constraints, pinned package versions, environment variables, etc.)
   - [agentplanning.agent.md](../.github/agents/agentplanning.agent.md) — The specific role and persona for the `agentplanning` agent, discovered by **VS Code** from `.github/agents/*.agent.md` and selectable from the *Agents* dropdown

❸ **Workspace context** — Copilot examines files in your workspace to understand structure and data, such as `README.md`, `technicians.json`, `work-orders.json`, and your existing code files. This helps it generate code that fits your project.

❹ **Tools and data (MCP)** — Copilot can be equipped with additional tools exposed via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to accomplish more complex tasks. **This is very similar to how our agents in [challenge 1](../challenge-1/README.md) were equipped with tools** — just as we gave the **Fault Diagnosis Agent** access to **Cosmos DB** queries and a knowledge base, you can extend Copilot with external data sources and capabilities.
